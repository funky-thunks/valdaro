# Valdaro - haskell library for server

## Content

This library is meant to be used along with the template and should help set
up classic server-side features such as:
- password verification and management
- API security via biscuits
- SQL migrations and connectivity
- configuration (via environment variables for now)

More features will end up in this library to support the typical features we
expect from a SaaS application as advertised in the [main Readme](../README.md).
